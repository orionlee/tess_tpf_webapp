# TESS Target Pixels Inspector

A web application to help users to identify the source of variable signals by allowing them to:

- inspect data at pixel level from TESS TargetPixelFiles or TESSCut
- view TESS pixels overlaying with data from TIC, Gaia DR3, ZTF Archive, ASAS-SN SkyPatrol v2, and VSX.

The main features are built on top of [`lightkurve`](https://github.com/lightkurve/lightkurve/).

For now, the source codes are in a separate repository:
